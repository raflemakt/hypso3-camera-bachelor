# Minimal V4L2 capture example
A lobotimized and flattened version of the Linux kernel documentation example
`capture.c`.

Tries to capture from `/dev/video0`. A lot of error checks etc. are removed as an attempt to make the code more comprehensible.

## Usage
```
make
make img
```

Tested on Gunnar's Linux laptop (Thinkpad E595)
